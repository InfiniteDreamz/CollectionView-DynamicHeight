# CollectionView-DynamicHeight
This is a sample project aiming to achieve a self sizing collection view cell with dynamic height. 

Following are the key points of this demo project: 

1. I have wrapped all the labels in a containerView [UIView] which is having all the 4 constraints w.r.t. the UICollectiionViewCell. 
2. UICollectionViewCell must be created just like auto resizing UITableViewCell satsifying all the auto layout constraints. 
3. Its wroking without assigning any estimated Size for the cell or without using any other method like sizeThatFits() etc.

Happy Coding !!
